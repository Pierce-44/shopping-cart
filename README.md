# Shopping Cart App
A shopping cart app, which was developed using React, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. This app was developed to expand my learning and understanding of React and React page routing options through the React Router Dom package. This app was developed and conducted to be submitted as my assignment for [The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript Shopping Cart Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart) <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/assets/icons/odin-icon-b5b31c073f7417a257003166c98cc23743654715305910c068b93a3bf4d3065d.svg"  width="20" height="20">.
